# Turn-Based Battle Simulation

This project is a turn-based battle simulation implemented in C# using a console application. It features a basic game engine, a unit class, and a program to run the simulation between a player and an AI opponent.

## GameEngine Class

The `GameEngine` class manages the turn-based simulation between two units. It includes methods for player and AI turns, handling different actions such as attack, heal, and ultimate abilities.

## Program Class

The `Program` class contains the entry point for the application, creating instances of the `Unit` class for the player and AI, and initiating the battle simulation using the `GameEngine`.

## Unit Class

The `Unit` class represents a character in the battle, with properties and methods for managing health, attack, healing, and ultimate abilities.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your C# development environment.
3. Run the `Program` class to start the turn-based battle simulation.

Feel free to modify and expand upon the classes and methods to enhance the functionality of your game. Enjoy the battle simulation!
